ðŸŽ¬ Fandango's Movie Review Report
 Project Overview
This project is part of a guided investigation into whether **Fandango**, a popular movie ratings aggregator, was inflating its displayed ratings compared to the actual ratings stored in their system.  
In 2015, data journalist Walt Hickey revealed discrepancies between Fandangoâ€™s displayed star ratings and the true ratings found in the page HTML.  
The goal of this project was to:
- Confirm the inflation using 2015 data.
- Compare results with 2016â€“17 data to check if Fandango adjusted its rating system after the public investigation.

  Datasets
- fandango_score_comparison.csv â€“ Ratings from 2015 (both displayed and true values).
- movie_ratings_16_17.csv â€“ Ratings from 2016â€“17 (displayed values).

 Key Findings
| Metric | 2015 Displayed | 2015 True | 2016â€“17 Displayed |
|--------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Mean   | 4.10           | 3.90      | 3.90              |

âœ… **2015:** Displayed ratings were consistently higher than true ratings, confirming inflation.  
âœ… **2016â€“17:** Displayed ratings aligned closely with the previous true ratings, suggesting Fandango adjusted its system.
